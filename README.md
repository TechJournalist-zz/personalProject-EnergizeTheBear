# Energize the Bear: My First Pebble Watchface

The goal is to create a Watchface that changes image, from a happy bear to a sleepy bear, based on the battery level. I have never did a WatchFace yet, so wish me luck!

##Language:
C on Pebble Cloud

##Progress:
* Got the time and date in. Got a placeholder image, time, and date in the right place. (08/30/16)
